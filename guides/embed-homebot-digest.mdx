title: "Embed a Homebot Digest"
description: "You can add a script to embed the full Homebot experience for your clients on your portal or website. This feature needs to be enabled for you by the Homebot team."
---

## Requirements

1. For security, the call to generate a client token must be done from the backend. Do NOT expose your customer token to your frontend.
2. The client must be logged into a non-publicly accessible page. Homebot contains non-public information. Don't expose it to the world.
3. The area you're displaying the widget should be at least 320px wide. Bigger's better! We recommend a more full size view. It will automatically expand vertically to be as tall as necessary to prevent a scrollbox.

## Integration Steps

1. Using a customer token, generate a client token.
2. On a page that your client has logged in to, embed the widget html code passing the token generated in step 1 to the `data-token` attribute. Place the code where you want the widget to display.

```Java
<div data-homebot-root="true" data-contact-id="CONTACT_ID" data-token="YOUR_TOKEN"></div>
```

3. Place this script near the end of your page before the `</body>` tag

```Java
<script src="https://api.homebot.ai/v0.1.0/sdk.js" async></script>
<script>
Homebot.domReady(function() { // Optional domReady handler
Homebot.init();
});
</script>
```
